His father was an art teacher and painter. As  young child Picasso had immense talent for art. Due to this his father began teaching him, as he grew up he spent more time drawing rather than doing school work. </p>

<p>1895, Picasso and his family moved to Barcelona, Spain. He later was accepted to one of the best art schools in the area. He moved to Madrid where the school was located.Due to not licking the strict rules that were placed he began skipping classes.
</p>

<p>Once he turned 16 in 1897 he moved back to Barcelona. There he met with other artists in the cafe “ El Quatre Gats “. There he became inspired to attempt different art styles.
</p>

<p>Later he moved to Paris, This is where he experienced his blue period. This a period where picasso went through a stage of depression.

<p>Then in 1907 picasso began painting in at the time some new style, cubism.  He started with distorted shapes that eventually became different images symbolic of different things. Supposedly the idea of cubism is using reality as a means and not an end.
</p>

<p>Later during the start of world war one picasso began again to get into realism.Between 1918-1927 became known as his classic period. Then began his break into surrealism. Surrealism came from picasso's cubism. One of his most well known painting was a surrealist due to a spanish bombing that had occurred. The painting being  “guernica”. It still is a powerful anti war painting used to this day.
</p>
